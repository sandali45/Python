# A tuple is a collection that is:
# - Ordered: The items are in a specific sequence.
# - Unchangeable: The items in a tuple cannot be changed after creation.
# - Allows duplicate values: You can have repeated elements in a tuple.
# - Indexed: Each element has a specific position, starting from index 0.

# Example of a tuple
thistuple = ("Sua", "kai", "soobin")
print(thistuple)  # Prints the tuple

# Tuples allow duplicate values
thistuple = ("Sua", "kai", "soobin", "Sua", "kai", "soobin")
print(thistuple)  # Prints the tuple with duplicate elements

# Tuples can hold any data type
thistuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)  # Tuple with integers
print(f"The length is: {len(thistuple)}")  # Prints the length of the tuple

# A tuple with a single element (note the comma is required for it to be recognized as a tuple)
thistuple = ("sua",)
print(type(thistuple))  # Prints <class 'tuple'>

# If you create a tuple without a trailing comma, it will not be recognized as a tuple
thistuple = ("sua")
print(type(thistuple))  # Prints <class 'str'> because itâ€™s interpreted as a string

# Examples of tuples with different data types
tuple1 = ("Sua", "kai", "soobin")  # Tuple with strings
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)  # Tuple with integers
tuple3 = (True, False, False)  # Tuple with boolean values
print(tuple1)  # Prints tuple1
print(tuple2)  # Prints tuple2
print(tuple3)  # Prints tuple3
